Voting on Games and updating a users votes

Admin Dashboard utilities

User buys merch and update points spent and balance

Update Landing Page photos to resemble the finished site (games, shop, badges, etc.)

sample sql injection to "truncate" a db table called (eg) Secrets
firstName field: "David ; DELETE FROM Secrets --"
David ; DROP table USERS
note: sqlLite truncates using the "DELETE" keyword

Because we are using entity framework, all queries are converted to parameterized sql statements and therefore protect against sql injections such as the "DELETE" example.

Landing Page - Website Banner, Carousel of images, and sign up button

***
Need to run through testing of users voting, 
admins setting points, and paying out votes, 
and then users shopping for merch with those points

SQL injection example:
David ; DELETE FROM Secrets --

CREATE TABLE USERS (
	Id data_type PRIMARY KEY,
   	Name data_type NOT NULL
);

DROP Table USERS
